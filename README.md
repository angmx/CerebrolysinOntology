# Medical Diagnosis Support Ontology: CERPRO
CErebrolysin Research PRotocol Ontology (CERPRO) for supporting medical diagnosis through knowledge inference.
The aim is to: 
1) assist the first-contact hospital’s general physician during the patient evaluation to obtain a close diagnosis and to determine the candidates for receiving the Cerebrolysin treatment (CRP Protocol).
2) support the INR’s neurology researcher to identify candidate patients, who fulfil the CRP protocol's requirements, without physically attending the first-contact hospitals for an in-person evaluation.
3) The main beneficiated actor is the neurology specialist, and also the General Practitioner Physician (GP), who does not usually have the expertise for evaluating CRP Protocol's requirement fulfilment.

CERPRO is based on the healthcare top-level ontology: OpenGalen [1], for obtaining the sicknesses and drugs modelling. The CERPRO application in a hospital real setting has been presented in the paper:
